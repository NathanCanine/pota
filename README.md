Paradox Of The Algae Work

The paradox of the algae can be considered as such.

We have N species of algae and at least one limiting nutrient (x).  The change in population of species i will be defined with the following function:

di/dx = fi(x)

Also, we can assume that the overall presence of the limiting nutrient can be provided by the following function:

x = k1 * a1 + k2 * a2 + k3 * a3 + ... + kn * an

If we assume that fi(x) is a linear function, this system is trivially stable.

Here we explore the stability of various fi(x) distributions.
